Household net wealth is aggregated individual net wealth.\nWe calculate individuals’ wealth ranks in the distribution of the full population for each cross-section and assign this position as our wealth measure. Rank ties are broken by random assignment.\nFor each respondent, we use the wealth observation that is closest to age 40 within the age window 25–55 years to account for possible life-cycle patterns."
