However, direct (bivariate) parent-child correlations in wealth may miss important aspects of the intergenerational reproduction of wealth which do not go directly through wealth.\n\nIf family and community background matter for children’s attainment, two siblings sharing this background should be more similar to each other than two randomly matched persons.\n\n\n\\(\\Rightarrow\\) The study of siblings’ similarity in outcomes is instructive to assess how the family and other shared factors influence these outcomes (Grätz et al. 2021; Mazumder 2008; Schnitzlein 2014; Solon 1999; Solon et al. 1991)."

Estimates of sibling correlations in Sweden are of similar size with 0.32, while they are smaller in Norway (about 0.20–0.30). Comparable empirical studies on wealth are not available for Germany.\n\n\nPrevious results suggest that sibling similarity in wealth is less pronounced for women than for men."
